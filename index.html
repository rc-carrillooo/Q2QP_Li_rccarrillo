    <h1>UNICEF, FOR EVERY CHILD</h1>

<section class="background">
    <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
    <h3>The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) was established in 1946, in the aftermath of World War II. Our mandate was clear: to help children and young people whose lives and futures were at risk – no matter what role their country had played in the war. <br>

        What mattered to UNICEF was reaching every child in need, protecting children’s rights to survive, thrive, and reach their full potential.<br> 
        
        This is the DNA of UNICEF. From the ashes of war to the global challenges that affect millions today, our mandate has never wavered. UNICEF has consistently worked to protect the rights and well-being of all children. Whoever they are. Wherever they live.</h3>

    <h1>ACHIEVEMENTS</h1>
    <h3>When the world’s most vulnerable children have needed a champion, UNICEF has been there. From short-term relief during armed conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian crises to long-term survival and development programmes, we have helped build resilient health and welfare systems across the globe. We have defeated diseases, provided essential services, education and skills and developed healthier and safer environments for children and their families everywhere. <br>
    For 75 years, UNICEF has brought relief and assistance to many parts of the world. The agency has contributed to worldwide health through global immunization efforts towards children. UNICEF has offered methods and ways to strengthen learning all over the world---providing quality education to even the farthest ends of the globe. UNICEF also advocates for mental health, calling for the end to child neglect and abuse. It has made efforts to ease climate change---it continues to fight for a better world for future generations.</h3>
